# Daily COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Visualization

This project fetches the latest COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, filters the data for the last 30 days, and creates a line chart visualization using Altair.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

\```bash
pip install pandas altair requests
\```

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

\```bash
python main.py
\```

This will create a line chart and save it as an HTML file named `daily-covid-cases.html` in the project directory.

## Data Source
